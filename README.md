Deep learning (DL) is an integral part of vehicle detection from road videos captured by unmanned aerial vehicles for effective traffic management. This detection followed by tracking can facilitate parameterized tasks in relation to road traffic, such as flow rate, average speed, and density, which are performed periodically. However, the inherent susceptibility of DL models to adversarial samples substantially diminishes their effectiveness in traffic extraction. Due to the multi-stage processing and multiple loss functions in Faster R-CNN, more opportunities for adversarial manipulations than other DL models are becoming possible. We herein propose a Periodic Adversarial Attack for Aerial Video (P3AV), as a powerful method to fool the Faster R-CNN model in the vehicle recognition task from aerial videos. The Bayesian optimisation and a heuristic mechanism are employed, respectively, to select critical video frames and pixels for perturbing using an improved Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm.
